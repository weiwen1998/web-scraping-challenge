# web-scraping-challenge

#The data and images are generated and scraped with Pandas before downloading it into a Python file

#An app.py is performed - and then scraped towards forming a website - using the Python file generated from Pandas.

#Once the app.py is run - a URL is formed - and it links to the website

#The data is scraped - and all of the images are formed.
